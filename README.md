# midterm project: 
Three levels, must finish the previous level to proceed to the next one
some solutions of level 1 and level 2 are in the midterm presentation slides for reference

use mouse to create polygon.
open sound. There is feedback sound when two particles collide
explore the function of different keys: "d","a","c","t","b"; how they can combine to create different solutions to each level
Features:
1) break the polygons apart by pressing "t" (switching from break: true/false); 
2) stop particles from falling down by pressing "d" (switching from down: true/false);
3) collect goal particles by pressing "a"
4) clear everything from screen (particles & polygons) by pressing "c"
5) create polygons that are filled with a color by pressing "b"

Explore the Nitrogen Cycle! Get creative on tackling each level!
